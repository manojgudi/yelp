Hi Manoj, this script is a small, trivial python script to clean up scilab scripts and check for nooby mistakes (which you do often)
Also, you might want to know how to use this

Currently supports multi-line commmenting in scilab

For help:
`./yelp.py -h`

For commenting, check sample.sci how to use comment_markers; after which run this script
`./yelp.py -fc sample.sci`

*-f* forces the script to modify the sample.sci; if not used it will write in sample_modified.sci

*-c* is for multi-line commenting
